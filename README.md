# QUI built for React Components

This project was created by `create-react-app`.

```sh
  npm run styleguide
  # yarn run styleguide
```

Instead of running a react application, we use `react-styleguidist` to develop QUI components.

```sh
Style guide server started at:
http://0.0.0.0:6060
```

Please keep the `start`, `build`, `test` and leave `eject` alone from the npm scripts.
