# QUI built for React Components

This project was created by `create-react-app`.

## Installation

You can choose `npm` or `yarn` to install, for your preferences:

```sh
  npm i # yarn
  npm start # yarn run start
```

Instead of running a react application, we use `react-styleguidist` to develop QUI components:

```sh
Style guide server started at:
http://0.0.0.0:6060
```
